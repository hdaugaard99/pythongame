                    Main Street, right next to Shelli's Sherbet Shack. Your plot of land
                    includes an oven, card table, and bucket. It looks odd next to all of
                    the extravagent buildings around it.

                                will be the eggs. The Chicken Coop is located just outside
                                of Sweetsville. You tuck the recipe in your pocket and walk

                    I know that you came her to get some eggs, but you'll have to
                    win them. You'll have to answer an ancient riddle. If you
                    answer correctly, I will supply you with enough eggs to make
